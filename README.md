●	I initially learned Java, which laid the foundation for my programming skills. During high school, I learned HTML, creating a basic website with a menu bar. I enjoyed programming in my Engineering 101 course as well. I collaborated with a group of two on a project where we built a functional model car using LEGO pieces, incorporating an Arduino Uno motherboard using Arduino IDE (to program the car to move forward, backwards, left, right, circle, make an eight shape, etc). This car, powered by a battery, featured a working motor, a servo (was attached to the front wheels of the car to control its turning/steering) and a light sensor. The sensor-enabled the car to move in response to light detection, a feature I implemented by modifying the C++ program. In another individual project also using Arduino IDE, I developed a touchscreen and LCD interface to control LED light density. This project also included a fun, interactive touchpoint program, allowing users to draw on the screen in eight different colors. Afterwards, I decided to pick computer science as my undergrad major. Relevant Coursework: Computer Science (I, II Data Structures and III), Assembly Language & Computer Architecture, Object Oriented Programming, Software Engineering, Digital Logic Fundamentals, Discrete Mathematics For Computing. Right now, I am taking Discrete & Cont Algorithms and Software Engineering as well. 
 
●	Web programming is something I found very interesting and fun when I learned it in high school, I am excited about deepening my knowledge in this area. This is a great opportunity for me to enhance my programming skills and utilize them. I would like to pursue a career in software development, I am confident that the knowledge and experience gained from this course will be integral to achieving this goal. Furthermore, I believe this course will be beneficial regardless of the specific path I choose in the field of technology.
